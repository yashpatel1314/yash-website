    "longDescription": "• Developed a sheet metal bending program to bend this part 6 times from scratch using the INFORM II programming language.\n• Programs were split into 3 sections, one for picking, one for bending, and one for stacking.\n• Parts could only be bent certain ways so I required an \"adjustment table\" to put the part down and pick it up from another angle to bend it, this adjustment code was included in the bending program.\n• Stacking the part required extreme precision and required the robot to move slower than it normally would to ensure no parts fall off the stack and are damaged.\n• The robot had to move at a speed fast enough so that 50 parts could be bent in 4 hours safely.\n• I was able to guarantee double that in 3 hours.",
